The Cyclic redundancy check is a method to detect errors in a given message by using binary division. Given message is concatonated with redundancy bits. This is then divided by the generator key which is obtained from the generator polynomial provided by the user. The remainder obtained after this division replaces the redundancy bits and this forms the encoded message. This is decoded by again implementing binary division with the key. If the remainder obtained is equal to zero, there is no error. If the remainder is not zero, then there is a error in the message.
